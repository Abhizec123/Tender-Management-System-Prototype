# Tender Management System
The Tender Management System is a 3rd Year course project that incorporates various concepts and methodologies to develop a comprehensive system for managing tenders. The project applies several essential techniques such as Customer Survey, Software Requirements Specification (SRS), Software Project Management Plan (SPMP), Data Flow Diagrams (DFD), COCOMO, Function Point Metrics (FPM), Gantt Chart, UML Modeling, Test Cases, ER Model, and Relational Model. The system is built using Java, JDBC, and MySQL to create a basic prototype.

# Introduction
The Tender Management System is designed to facilitate the process of managing tenders efficiently. It provides a centralized platform for creating, managing, and evaluating tenders. The system aims to streamline the tendering process, enhance transparency, and improve overall efficiency in tender management.

# Features
The Tender Management System incorporates the following key features:

1. User authentication and authorization: The system provides secure login functionality and assigns appropriate roles and permissions to users.

2. Tender creation and management: Users can create new tenders, specifying relevant details such as title, description, deadline, and submission requirements.

3. Tender evaluation: The system allows for the evaluation of tenders based on predefined criteria and scoring parameters.

4. Document management: Users can upload and manage relevant documents related to each tender.

5. Notifications: The system sends notifications to users regarding important updates, deadlines, and tender status.

6. Reporting and analytics: The system generates reports and provides analytics to track tender progress and performance.


# Concepts and Methodologies
The Tender Management System incorporates various concepts and methodologies to ensure a robust and well-structured development process. The following are the key concepts utilized in this project:

Customer Survey: Conducted to gather requirements and preferences from potential users to align the system with their needs.

Software Requirements Specification (SRS): A document that defines the functional and non-functional requirements of the system.

Software Project Management Plan (SPMP): A comprehensive plan that outlines project scope, schedule, resources, and risk management strategies.

Data Flow Diagrams (DFD): Used to represent the flow of data within the system and understand the processes and interactions.

COCOMO: Constructive Cost Model used to estimate the effort, time, and resources required for the development of the system.

Function Point Metrics (FPM): A technique to measure the size and complexity of the system, aiding in estimating effort and cost.

Gantt Chart: A visual representation of the project schedule, showing tasks, dependencies, and timelines.

UML Modeling: Unified Modeling Language used for visualizing, specifying, constructing, and documenting the system's artifacts.

Test Cases: Designed to validate the functionality and performance of the system, ensuring it meets the specified requirements.

ER Model: Entity-Relationship model used to define the relationships between entities in the system.

Relational Model: Utilized to design the database schema and ensure efficient data storage and retrieval.


# Technologies Used
The Tender Management System is implemented using the following technologies:

Java: The core programming language used for system development.

JDBC: Java Database Connectivity is employed to interact with the MySQL database.

MySQL: The relational database management system used to store and manage data.
